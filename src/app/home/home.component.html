      <mat-card-content>
        I am currently working as a Software Developer on an internship at Vendasta Technologies in Saskatoon, SK. I have one
        semester of school remaining to complete a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Before starting computer science
        in 2017, I completed a degree in Chemical Engineering and worked in various engineering roles. During these jobs, I
        had an opportunity to develop simple software, which inspired me to pursue a career in technology.
